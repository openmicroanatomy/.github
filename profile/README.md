# ðŸ”¬ OpenMicroanatomy / QuPath Edu

OpenMicroanatomy is a free and open-source software to host & view whole slide images. It works in parallel with our QuPath extension called *QuPath Edu*, which adds new features to QuPath to make it more suitable as a learning / teaching tool, while still maintaining all the original features.
